# Conflict Resolution System for N-Agent Operations

## Overview

When running many agents continuously, conflicts are inevitable. The conflict resolution system handles these conflicts in real-time without stopping agent operations.

## Types of Conflicts

```python
class ConflictType(Enum):
    RESOURCE_CONFLICT = "resource"      # Multiple agents want same resource
    SPATIAL_CONFLICT = "spatial"        # Agents trying to occupy same space
    ACTION_CONFLICT = "action"          # Contradictory actions
    TEMPORAL_CONFLICT = "temporal"      # Timing-related conflicts
    STATE_CONFLICT = "state"           # Conflicting state changes
```

## Core Resolution System

```python
class ConflictResolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.action_queue = asyncio.PriorityQueue()
        self.conflict_handlers = {
            ConflictType.RESOURCE_CONFLICT: self.resolve_resource_conflict,
            ConflictType.SPATIAL_CONFLICT: self.resolve_spatial_conflict,
            ConflictType.ACTION_CONFLICT: self.resolve_action_conflict,
            ConflictType.TEMPORAL_CONFLICT: self.resolve_temporal_conflict,
            ConflictType.STATE_CONFLICT: self.resolve_state_conflict
        }
        
    async def resolve_conflicts(self, actions):
        # Group actions by conflict potential
        conflict_groups = self.identify_conflict_groups(actions)
        
        resolved_actions = []
        for group in conflict_groups:
            if self.has_conflict(group):
                resolved = await self.apply_resolution_strategy(group)
                resolved_actions.extend(resolved)
            else:
                resolved_actions.extend(group)
                
        return resolved_actions
```

## Conflict Detection

```python
class ConflictDetector:
    def identify_conflict_groups(self, actions):
        """Group potentially conflicting actions"""
        groups = {
            'spatial': defaultdict(list),    # Group by location
            'resource': defaultdict(list),   # Group by resource
            'temporal': defaultdict(list),   # Group by time window
            'state': defaultdict(list)       # Group by state impact
        }
        
        for action in actions:
            # Spatial grouping
            if hasattr(action, 'location'):
                key = self.spatial_hash(action.location)
                groups['spatial'][key].append(action)
                
            # Resource grouping
            if hasattr(action, 'resource'):
                groups['resource'][action.resource].append(action)
                
            # Add other groupings...
            
        return self.merge_overlapping_groups(groups)
```

## Resolution Strategies

### 1. Priority-Based Resolution

```python
class PriorityResolver:
    async def resolve_by_priority(self, conflicting_actions):
        """Resolve conflicts based on agent priorities"""
        # Sort by priority and timestamp
        sorted_actions = sorted(
            conflicting_actions,
            key=lambda x: (x.priority, x.timestamp)
        )
        
        # Take highest priority action
        selected_action = sorted_actions[0]
        
        # Generate compensation actions for others
        compensations = [
            self.generate_compensation(action)
            for action in sorted_actions[1:]
        ]
        
        return selected_action, compensations
```

### 2. Spatial Resolution

```python
class SpatialResolver:
    def resolve_spatial_conflict(self, actions):
        """Resolve spatial conflicts using distance and trajectories"""
        spatial_groups = self.group_by_proximity(actions)
        
        resolved = []
        for group in spatial_groups:
            if len(group) > 1:
                # Calculate alternative positions
                alternatives = self.calculate_alternative_positions(group)
                # Assign new positions based on priorities
                resolved.extend(self.assign_positions(group, alternatives))
            else:
                resolved.extend(group)
                
        return resolved
```

### 3. Resource Conflict Resolution

```python
class ResourceResolver:
    async def resolve_resource_conflict(self, actions):
        """Handle conflicts over shared resources"""
        resource_locks = {}
        
        async def acquire_resource(action):
            resource = action.resource
            if resource not in resource_locks:
                resource_locks[resource] = asyncio.Lock()
                
            async with resource_locks[resource]:
                # Check if resource still available
                if await self.is_resource_available(resource):
                    return action
                else:
                    return self.generate_alternative_action(action)
                    
        # Process all resource requests
        results = await asyncio.gather(*[
            acquire_resource(action)
            for action in actions
        ])
        
        return [r for r in results if r is not None]
```

## Compensation System

```python
class CompensationManager:
    def generate_compensation(self, rejected_action):
        """Generate compensation for rejected actions"""
        compensation = {
            'agent_id': rejected_action.agent_id,
            'type': 'compensation',
            'original_action': rejected_action,
            'alternatives': self.find_alternatives(rejected_action),
            'priority': rejected_action.priority
        }
        return compensation
    
    def find_alternatives(self, action):
        """Find alternative actions when original is rejected"""
        if action.type == 'move':
            return self.find_alternative_paths(action)
        elif action.type == 'resource_use':
            return self.find_alternative_resources(action)
        # Add other action types...
```

## Example Usage

```python
# Example of handling multiple agent actions
async def process_agent_actions(actions):
    resolver = ConflictResolver()
    detector = ConflictDetector()
    
    # Group potentially conflicting actions
    conflict_groups = detector.identify_conflict_groups(actions)
    
    # Process each group
    resolved_actions = []
    for group in conflict_groups:
        if detector.has_conflict(group):
            # Resolve conflicts
            resolution = await resolver.resolve_conflicts(group)
            resolved_actions.extend(resolution)
            
            # Generate compensations for affected agents
            compensations = resolver.generate_compensations(
                original=group,
                resolved=resolution
            )
            
            # Queue compensations for affected agents
            await queue_compensations(compensations)
        else:
            resolved_actions.extend(group)
            
    return resolved_actions
```

## Real-World Example

```python
# Example of resolving movement conflicts in a shared space
async def resolve_movement_conflicts():
    # Current agent positions and intended moves
    agent_moves = {
        'agent_1': {'current': (0,0), 'target': (1,1)},
        'agent_2': {'current': (2,2), 'target': (1,1)},
        'agent_3': {'current': (1,0), 'target': (1,1)}
    }
    
    resolver = SpatialResolver()
    
    # Resolve conflicts
    resolved_positions = await resolver.resolve_spatial_conflict(agent_moves)
    
    # Example output:
    # {
    #     'agent_1': {'new_target': (0.9, 1.1)},  # Slightly adjusted
    #     'agent_2': {'new_target': (1.1, 0.9)},  # Slightly adjusted
    #     'agent_3': {'new_target': (1.1, 1.1)}   # Slightly adjusted
    # }
```

## Best Practices

1. **Fairness in Resolution**
   - Rotate priorities periodically
   - Track and balance rejected actions
   - Provide alternative actions when possible

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use spatial hashing for quick conflict detection
   - Batch similar conflicts
   - Cache recent resolutions

3. **Monitoring and Debugging**
   ```python
   class ConflictMonitor:
       def __init__(self):
           self.conflict_stats = {
               'total_conflicts': 0,
               'resolution_times': [],
               'conflict_types': Counter(),
               'affected_agents': Counter()
           }
           
       def log_conflict(self, conflict):
           self.conflict_stats['total_conflicts'] += 1
           self.conflict_stats['conflict_types'][conflict.type] += 1
           # Add more stats...
   ```
